	<h1>Monthly Playlists</h1>
	<p> Every month, for the past few years, I've made a collaborative playlist. Here is a link to the current one. I used to use Spotify because most people have Spotify, but as time goes on Spotify has less of the music I wantto listen to, so I've transitioned to YouTube Music. You don't need a YouTube music account to add songs nor do you need one to listen, it's basically just a YouTube playlist.</p>

	<h1>Finite Musical Group Theory</h1>
	I have some notes on applications of finite group theory applied to music theory. Don't worry, I think Neo-Riemannian theory is boring too, there's other stuff.
